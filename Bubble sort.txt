First take an array as input(collection of similar datatype elements).
Then intialize another variable i with 0 as value.
Take one for loop from i=1 to n.(as in first itaration one element will already be sorted)
Inside the first loop take another loop from j=0 to n-1
ascending:
     if the current element is greater than next element then swap the elements.
descending:
     if the current element is smaller than next element then swap the elements.
Display the eelements of array.
End
